\section{IAFoosball}
IAFoosball is the name of the project and startup we developed in the previous semester. It is meant to make foosball more interactive, to show and share statistics, and make it more sociable by using new technologies. The planned services include global and private rankings, table finder, friends, automatic tournaments and more. Because it is part of an university project, we used the latest and greatest technology. The front end is written in Flutter and preact, the back end in Go and all communication is done through gRPC, which uses proto buffs and HTTP/2 (i.e. SPDY). Figure shows the foosball table. It is the development version, so all features we would like to offer are included here. They include, speakers with Spotify integration, LED lights, automatic ball release and a tablet.
