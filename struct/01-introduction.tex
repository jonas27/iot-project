\section{Introduction}
The Internet of Things (IoT) will change humanity in profound and unforeseeable ways\cite{ciscoReport}. According to a report by Cisco, between 2015 and 2020 the number of connected IoT devices is set to double from 25 billion to 50 billion\cite{ciscoReport}. This means more data than ever will be collected and automation will be the norm, rather than the exception. Industrial IoT (IIoT) and smart home are prime example for this. New factories are often operated by only a few workers and lights and temperature are increasingly controlled by an AI rather than the human living in it. This leads to higher productivity, better power management and more comfort among other improvements. In most cases, this new technology is used to aid humans, but recent history has shown that IoT brings many diverse challenges in technology, security and social life.\\
In 2016 a botnet with over 600k infected devices, primarily embedded and IoT devices, overwhelmed several high-profile targets like the DNS provider Dyn with a massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. This caused a temporary outage of their DNS servers making many webpages, among others  Twitter, Spotify und Amazon, temporally inaccessible.\\
The sheer number of IoT devices also makes it important to think about their sustainability. Many IoT devices are cheap to manufacturer and thus only used for a short period of time and are hard to update. This makes basically makes them a throwaway product. Many IoT devices have a stable power connection and are not designed to be energy efficient. \\
IoT devices are by design often close to humans and are intended to analyze what they say, do and how their body reacts. This leads many people to assume that IoT, especially smart home and activity tracking are incompatible with privacy\cite{5Reasons41:online}. In the past many companies overstepped the line what is socially excepted and had to back-roll certain "features"\cite{PrivacyIoT50:online}. For many consumers, privacy is the major concern in smart home\cite{PrivacyIoT50:online}.\\
These three areas, security, sustainability and privacy, have influenced the technology and architecture of the product developed as part of this project. The reminder or this report is structured as follows,
